This contains a simple Blackjack game I made in Python. This starts the user with $60, as that's the amount I usually bring to the casino to start, and starts the user off with a $10 bet. $10 is the minimum bet for this table, as this is what it normally is at the casino. The two "table rules" to this game are that the dealer hits on a soft 17 and the player wins 2:1 on blackjacks, to keep the player's balance at a clean even number. The user can hit, split, or double down, when able to. When splitting aces, the player is only allowed one card on each with no option to take further hits on either split hand.
